> The Tribe needs a new Shaman after the old one disappeared mysteriously. Some say his dance moves weren't divine enough. And that's where you come into play(pun intended). Fullfill your duty by praying to the gods for sunshine or pick up the rattle and play a song to summon rain. But watch out, too much rain will flood the village and too much sun will bring drought - either way, death would be certain. To keep the village alive you have to try your hardest. If you survive for three minutes, the gods will be pleased and you will be free.

Intially developed for the HTC Vive, this is what my team came up with during the Global Game Jam 2016 in Munich. I forked the repository we originally developed on because i want to port this to the Oculus Rift. This needs a lot of modifications, especially in terms of game design since the rift doesn't have any fancy position-tracked peripherals like the vive has. 

You can find the HTC Vive Version of the game (http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/shaman-vr "here").
